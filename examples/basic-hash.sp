# BASIC HASH

The Basic Hash protocol as described in [A] is an RFID protocol involving:

* a tag associated to a secret key;
* generic readers having access to a database containing all these keys.

The protocol is as follows:

```
T --> R : <nT, h(nT,key)>
R --> T : ok
```

In this file, we prove two security properties for this protocol.

* We first prove an **authentication** property for the reader.

* We then prove **unlinkability**, _i.e._ the equivalence between
  a **real** system (where each tag can play multiple sessions) and
  an **ideal** system (where each tag plays only one session).

include Core.

(** We start by declaring the function symbol `h` for the hash function,
    as well as two public constants `ok` and `ko` (used by the reader). *)

hash h

abstract ok : message
abstract ko : message.

(** In order to model the real system and the ideal system, we will use two
    different name symbols for the tags' secret keys.
    The symbol `key` has index arity 1 and will be used in the real system,
    while the symbol `key'` has index arity 2 and will be used in the ideal
    system so that each new session of a tag uses a new key. *)

name key  : index -> message
name key' : index * index -> message

(** Finally, we declare the channels used by the protocol. *)

channel cT
channel cR.

(** The tag's role is modelled by the following process, indexed by `i` (for
    the identity of the tag) and by `k` (for the session of a given identity).
    The tag starts by generating a fresh random name `nT`, then outputs a
    message built using `key(i)` in the real system and `key'(i,k)` in the
    ideal system. *)

process tag(i:index,k:index) =
  new nT;
  out(cT, <nT, h(nT,diff(key(i),key'(i,k)))>).

(** The reader's role is modelled by the following process. Since readers are
    generic, the process is indexed only by `j` (for the session).
    The reader starts by inputting a message `x` before checking whether this
    message corresponds to a legitimate output performed by a tag.
    On the left side (the real system), the reader looks up for a key `key(i)`
    in the database (the one corresponding to the tag of identity `i`).
    On the right side (the ideal system), the reader looks up for a key
    `key(i,k)` in the database (the one used by the tag of identity `i` at
    session `k`). *)

process reader(j:index) =
  in(cT,x);
  if exists (i,k:index), snd(x) = h(fst(x),diff(key(i),key'(i,k))) then
    out(cR,ok)
  else
    out(cR,ko).

(** The system is finally defined by putting an unbounded number of tag and
    reader processes in parallel.
    This system is automatically translated to a set of actions:

    * the initial action (`init`);
    * one action for the tag (`T`);
    * two actions for the reader, corresponding to the two branches of the
      conditional (respectively `R` and `R1`). *)

system BasicHash = ((!_j R: reader(j)) | (!_i !_k T: tag(i,k))).

(** Whenever a reader accepts a message (_i.e._ the condition of the action
    `R(j)` evaluates to `true`), there exists an action `T(i,k)` that has been
    executed before the reader, and such that the input of the reader
    corresponds to the output of this tag (and conversely).

    The same holds for `R1` (the else branch of the reader) but with a negation.
    We will prove once and for all a property that is generalized for any
    `tau`, which will be useful later for `tau = R(j)` and `tau = R1(j)`.

    Note that we express our correspondence property on each projection of the
    pair. Indeed, for some implementations of the pairing primitive, the
    equality of projections does not imply the equality of pairs. *)
lemma [BasicHash] wa_R :
  forall (tau:timestamp),
    happens(tau) =>
    ((exists (i,k:index),
       snd(input@tau) = h(fst(input@tau),diff(key(i),key'(i,k))))
     <=>
     (exists (i,k:index), T(i,k) < tau &&
       fst(output@T(i,k)) = fst(input@tau) &&
       snd(output@T(i,k)) = snd(input@tau))).
(** The high-level idea of the proof is to use the EUF cryptographic axiom:
    only the tag `T(i,k)` can forge `h(nT(i,k),key(i))` because the secret key
    is not known by the attacker.
    Therefore, any message accepted by the reader must come from a tag that has
    played before.
    The converse implication is trivial because any honest tag output is
    accepted by the reader. *)
Proof.

  (** We have to prove two implications (`<=>`): we thus split the proof
      in two parts. We now have two different goals to prove.*)

  (** For the first implication (=>), we actually prove it separately for the
      real system (left) and the ideal system (right).*)
  + project.
    (** The proof is very similar on both sides and relies on the `euf` tactic.
        Applying the `euf` tactic on the `Meq` hypothesis generates a new
        hypothesis stating that `fst(input@R(j))` must be equal to some message
        that has already been hashed before.
        The only possibility is that this hash comes from the output of a tag
        that has played before (thus the new hypothesis on timestamps).*)

    ++ (* RIGHT *)

  (** For the second implication (<=), the conclusion of the goal can directly
       be obtained from the hypotheses.*)

(** We now prove an equivalence property expressing unlinkability of the
    protocol. This property is expressed by the logic formula
    `forall t:timestamp, frame@t`
    where `frame@t` is actually a bi-frame. We will have to prove that the left
    projection of `frame@t` (_i.e._ the real system) is indistinguishable from
    the right projection of `frame@t` (_i.e._ the ideal system). *)

equiv [BasicHash] unlinkability.
(** The high-level idea of the proof is as follows:

    * if `t` corresponds to a reader's action, we show that the outcome of the
      conditional is the same on both sides and that this outcome only depends
      on information already available to the attacker;

    * if `t` corresponds to a tag's action, we show that the new message added
      in the frame (_i.e._ the tag's output) does not give any information to
      the attacker to distinguish the real system from the ideal one since
      hashes can intuitively be seen as fresh names thanks to the PRF
      cryptographic axiom. *)
Proof.
  (** The proof is done by induction over the timestamp `t`.
      The `induction` tactic also automatically introduces a case analysis over
      all the possible values for `t`.
      The first case, where `t = init`, is trivial.
      The other cases correspond to the 3 different actions of the protocol. *)
  induction t; 1: auto.

  (** **Case where t = R(j):**
      We start by expanding the macros and splitting the pairs. *)
  + expand frame, exec, output. fa !<_,_>.
    (** Using the authentication goal `wa_R` previously proved, we replace the
        formula `cond@R(j)` by an equivalent formula expressing the fact that
        a tag `T(i,k)` has played before and that the output of this tag is
        the message inputted by the reader. *)
    rewrite /cond (wa_R (R j)) //.
    (** We are now able to remove this formula from the frame because
        the attacker is able to compute it using information obtained
        in the past. Indeed, each element of this formula is already available
        in `frame@pred(R(j))`. This is done by the `deduce` tactic. *)
    by deduce 1.
    
  (** **Case where t = R1(j):**  
      This case is similar to the previous one. *)
  + expand frame, exec, output. fa !<_,_>.
    rewrite /cond (wa_R (R1 j)) //.
    by deduce 1.

  (** **Case where t = T(i,k):**  
  We start by expanding the macros and splitting the pairs. *)
  + expand frame, exec, cond, output.
    fa !<_,_>, if _ then _, <_,_>.
    (** We now apply the `prf` tactic, in order to replace the hash by a fresh
        name. The tactic actually replaces the hash by a conditional term in
        which the then branch is the fresh name.
        The goal is now to prove that this condition always evaluates to
        `true`. *)
    prf 2.
  (** Several conjuncts must now be proved, the same tactic can be
  used on all of them. Here are representative cases:

  - In one case, `nT(i,k)` cannot occur in `input@R(j)`
    because `R(j) < T(i,k)`.
  - In another case, `nT(i,k) = nT(i0,k0)` implies that `i=i0` and `k=k0`,
    contradicting `T(i0,k0)<T(i,k)`.

  In both cases, the reasoning is performed by the fresh tactic on the
  message equality hypothesis `Meq` whose negation must initially be
  proved.
  To be able to use (split and) fresh, we first project the goal into
  into one goal for the left projection and one goal for the right
  projection of the initial bi-system. *)

      * repeat split; intro *; by fresh Meq.


    (** We have now replaced the hash by a fresh name occurring nowhere else,
        so we can remove it using the `fresh` tactic. *)
    * fresh 2; 1:auto.
    (** We can also remove the name `nT(i,k)`, and conclude by induction
        hypothesis. *)
