SIGNED DDH

[G] ISO/IEC 9798-3:2019, IT Security techniques – Entity authentication –
Part 3: Mechanisms using digital signature techniques.

P -> S : <pk(kP), g^a>
S -> P : <pk(kS),g^b>,sign(<<g^a,g^b>,pk(kP)>,kS)
P -> S : sign(<<g^b,g^a>,pk(kS)>,kP)

We leverage the composition result of [1], to prove the security of a single
session in the presence of an adversary with access to a "backdoor" about the
signature function, which allows him to about signatures of some specific
messages.

It means that we only consider two session of the agents, P and S, using a1 and
b1 as DH shares. We consider that the other sessions of P (simulated thanks to
the oracle), use a(i) as a DH share, and b(i) for the other sessions of S.

The proof is split into two systems:

 - [auth] - which models the authentication property, i.e. that P and S must be
partnered with an honnest session of the protocol.

 - [secret] - which models the secrecy property. i.e. that if P and S are
partenered together, the derived key is real-or-random.  Those two properties
allow to conclude through the result of [1] the multi-session security of DDH.
