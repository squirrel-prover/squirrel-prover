TOY EXAMPLE WITH STATE

System with tags only.

The goal is to prove the equivalence between:
- a system outputting the updated value kT(i) hashed with key(i) (ie same key for
all sessions of identity i),
- and a system outputting a fresh name at each session.

HELPING LEMMAS
- lastUpdate
- stateInequality

SECURITY PROPERTIES
- equivalence between real and ideal systems
