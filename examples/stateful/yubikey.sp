# YUBIKEY

The YubiKey is a simple physical authentication device with a unique button.
This device, manufactured by Yubico, allows users to securely authenticate to
their accounts by issuing a one-time password (OTP).

In its typical configuration, the YubiKey generates a random OTP by encrypting
a secret value and a counter.
This message is accepted by the server only if it decrypts under the correct
key to a valid secret value containing a counter whose value is larger than the
last value accepted by the server for that YubiKey.

In this model, we analyze the security of the protocol as described in [1],
assuming that the server remains secure.

Yubico assigns a key `k`, as well as a public and a secret identifier `pid, sid`
to each YubiKey. The counter `cpt` inside the YubiKey is incremented whenever the
YubiKey is plugged in, as well as when an OTP is generated, i.e. when the button
of the YubiKey is pressed. This OTP is obtained by encrypting the counter value
and the `sid` of the YubiKey with the key `k`.

* YubiKey -> Server : <pid,<nonce,senc(<sid,cpt>,npr,k)>>

Here, `npr` is the encryption randomness. The server accepts this message if it
decrypts with a legitimate key `k`, and leads to a valid secret value `sid`.
Lastly, the counter value obtained through decryption has to be larger than the
current value stored in the server database. After this exchange, the server
updates its counter with the value just received.

#### COMMENTS

* The OTP is an encryption of a triple `<sid, cpt, npr>`.
It is modelled here as a randomized encryption of a pair `<sid, cpt>`.
According to the specification in [1], AES is used.

* In [1], they "over-approximate in the case that the Yubikey increases the
session token by allowing the adversary to instantiate the rule for any counter
value that is higher than the previous one".
Here, we model the incrementation by 1 of the counter.

#### SECURITY PROPERTIES

The 3 security properties as stated in [1].

* Property 1: absence of replay attacks.
* Property 2: injective correspondence.
* Property 3: monotonicity.

(** #### SECURITY PROPERTIES

We now state and prove the 3 following security properties:

* Property 1: absence of replay attacks.
* Property 2: injective correspondence.
* Property 3: monotonicity.

******************************************
*)

(**
#### Property 1: absence of replay attacks
This property states that the server never accepts for the same YubiKey the
same counter twice, _i.e._ if the trace is executable up until `S(ii1,i)`,
then there cannot exist a previous action `S(ii,i)` in the trace such that
`ii <> ii1` and `SCpt(i)@S(ii,i) = SCpt(i)@S(ii1,i)`.

Note that proving this property does not rely on any assumption on cryptographic
primitives: it relies only on reasonings about counter values.
*)

(**
We start by proving an invariant (`noreplayInv`) that will be useful in the
main proof.
This intermediate lemma states that whenever the server accepts for a given
YubiKey (represented by the index `i`), the counter value must have increased
compared to the last time the server accepted for this YubiKey.
*)
lemma noreplayInv (ii, ii1, i:index):
  happens(S(ii1,i),S(ii,i)) =>
  exec@S(ii1,i) && S(ii,i) < S(ii1,i) =>
  SCpt(i)@S(ii,i) ~< SCpt(i)@S(ii1,i) = orderOk.
(** The proof relies on the previous helping lemmas reasoning on counter
values. *)
Proof.

(** #### Property 2: injective correspondence
This property states that a successful login for the YubiKey `pid(i)`
(_i.e._ the execution of action `S(ii,i)`) must have been preceded by
a button press on this YubiKey for the same counter value (`P(i,j)` with
`cpt(i,j)@Press(i,j) = SCpt(i)@S(ii,i)`), and this counter value is not
involved in another successful login.

Proving this property requires to reason on counter values, but also requires
the use of the INT-CTXT cryptographic assumption.

  happens(S(ii,i)) =>

      exec@S(ii1,i) =>
      cpt i j@Press(i,j) = SCpt(i)@S(ii1,i) => 
      ii1 = ii.
(** The high-level idea of this proof is to use the INT-CTXT assumption:
if the message received by the server is a valid ciphertext, then it must
be equal to an encryption that took place before.

Since the action `Press(i,j)` is the only one that outputs an encryption,
we thus have the existence of such an action before in the trace.
Then, the unicity is proved using lemmas on counter values.
