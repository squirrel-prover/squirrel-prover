(*******************************************************************************
RUNNING EXAMPLE

This protocol is a variant of the OSK protocol described in:
M. Ohkubo, K. Suzuki, S. Kinoshita et al.,
“Cryptographic approach to “privacy-friendly” tags,”
RFID privacy workshop, vol. 82. Cambridge, USA, 2003.

Each tag is associated to a mutable state sT initialized with s0.
Readers have access to a database containing an entry sR for each authorized
tag.

         sT := H(sT,k)
T -> R : G(sT,k')

         input x; sR := H(sR,k) if x = G(H(sR,k),k') with sR in DB
R -> T : ok

COMMENTS
- In this model we only consider tags (no hash oracles, no readers)
  the goal is to illustrate a realistic use of `apply ~inductive`
  on a minimal example.
