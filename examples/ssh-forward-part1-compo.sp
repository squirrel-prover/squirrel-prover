SSH

Original version:

P -> S : g^a
S -> P : g^b, pkS, sign(h(g^a,g^b, g^ab),skS) )
P -> S : enc( sign(g(g^a,g^b,g^ab),skP) , g^ab)

This protocol instantiate a key exchange, where the derived key is already used
inside the key exchange. This corresponds to the so called "key confirmation"
process. We leverage the composition results of [1] to prove the security of the
SSH protocol. This is done by proving the security of a single session of SSH,
while giving access to an oracle to the attacker, that allows him to simulate
either other honnest sessions of SSH, or other forwarded session.

As this protocol is a confirmation, we have to prove that

 * just after the key is derived, it satisfies the real-or-random property,
cf. system secret

 * if the key confirmation succeeds, two honnest sessions are paired together,
cf. system auth.

For the first point, we actually split the first message of S into two messages,
yielding the protocol:

P -> S : g^a
S -> P : g^b
S -> P:  pkS, sign(h(g^a,g^b, g^ab),skS) )
P -> S : enc( sign(g(g^a,g^b,g^ab),skP) , g^ab)


The security of a forwarded session when using a previously derived key is
proved in the file ssh-forward-part2-compo.sp. Together with [1], those two
files prove the security of SSH with one session forwarding for an unbounded
number of sessions.
