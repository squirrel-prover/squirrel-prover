# PRIVATE AUTHENTICATION

The Private Authentication protocol as described in [F] involves an initiator A
and a responder B.

The initiator A sends a message `enc(<pkA,n0>,r0,pkB)` to the responder B,
where `pkA` (respectively `pkB`) is the public key of A (respectively B).
The responder B checks that the first projection of the decryption of the
received message is equal to `pkA` and that the second projection of the
decryption of the received message has a correct length.
In that case, B sends back `enc(<n0,n>,r,pkA)`.

The protocol is as follows:

* A -> B : enc(<pkA,n0>,r0,pkB)
* B -> A : enc(<n0,n>,r,pkA)

This is a "light" model without the last check of A.

In this file, we prove anonymity, _i.e._ that an attacker cannot tell whether
a session is initiated by an identity A or by an identity Abis.

The initiator A is indexed by `i` to represent an unbounded number of sessions
and is defined by a single output.

(**
We define a similar process for the initiator Abis.

process Abis(i:index) =
  out(cAbis, enc(<pk(kAbis),n0bis(i)>,r0bis(i),pk(kB))).

(**
The responder B is indexed by `j` to represent an unbounded number of sessions.

In order to express anonymity using an equivalence property, we model two
systems using the `diff` operator.
On the left side, the key `kA` is used while the right side uses the key `kAbis`.

The protocol is finally defined by a system where an unbounded number of

public keys of A, Abis and B.

(**
The anonymity property is expressed as an equivalence between the left side
(the one using `kA` and the right side (the one using `kAbis`) of the system.
This property is expressed by the logic formula `forall t:timestamp, frame@t`
where `frame@t` is a bi-frame.
*)
equiv anonymity.
(**
The high-level idea of the proof is as follows: we show that the message
outputted by the role B does not give any element to the attacker
to distinguish the left side from the right side, relying on the fact that
encryption satisfies key privacy and IND-CCA1 assumptions.
*)
Proof.

  (**
  We start by adding to the frame the two public keys `pk(kA)`, `pk(kAbis)`
  and `pk(kB)` since any execution starts by the action `O` outputting them.
  This allows to simplify some cases in the proof below.

  This case is trivial thanks to the addition of `pk(kA)`, `pk(kAbis)`
  and `pk(kB)` in the frame.

  (** **Case where t = A(i):**  
  The output of this action is the same on both sides. We show that this
  output can be removed from the frame so that we can conclude by
  induction hypothesis.
  We start by expanding all macros and splitting the pairs and function
  applications. We are then left with the two names `n0(i)` and `r0(i)`
  used for the encryption. These names are fresh (_i.e._ does not appear
  anywhere else in the frame) so we are able to remove them with the
  `fresh` tactic.

  (**
  Thanks to the IND-CCA assumption, the ciphertext now only encrypts
  publicly known values that do not depend on the side.
  We now use the key privacy assumption: knowing only a ciphertext, it
  should not be possible to know which specific key was used.
  We apply a transitivity step first: enckp is applied on the left system,
  so that the only remaining diff is in 4.
