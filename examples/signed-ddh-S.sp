# SIGNED DDH

The signed DDH protocol as described in [G] features two roles, P and S.
Each role is associated to a secret key (skP and skS).

* P -> S : <pk(skP), g^a>
* S -> P : <pk(skS),g^b>,sign(<<g^a,g^b>,pk(skP)>,skS)
* P -> S : sign(<<g^b,g^a>,pk(skS)>,skP)

We consider multiple sessions but two agents only (one agent for the role P and
one agent for the role S) and show the strong secrecy of the shared key.

* In this file `signed-ddh-S.sp`, we show that the key g^a^b as computed by S
  is indistinguishable from g^k with k fresh (system secretS).
* In another file `signed-ddh-P.sp`, we show that the key g^a^b as computed by P
  is indistinguishable from g^k with k fresh (system secretP).

The system `secretS` is the counterpart of the system `secretP` defined in
the file `signed-ddh-P.sp`.

This time, we add an output at the end of the role of S.

(**
In the proof of strong secrecy for the system `secretS`, we will use
the following property, stating that whenever S accepts a message from P,
this message is of the form `<<_,x>,_>` where `x = g^a(i)`.

  happens(Schall1(j)) =>
    exec@Schall1(j) =>
      exists (i:index), snd(input@Schall(j)) = g^a(i).

We show the counterpart of the property `strongSecP`, this time for the
system `secretS`. The proof is carried out exactly in the same way.
