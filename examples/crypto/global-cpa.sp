(* Proof of indistinguishability for the two projections of the system.
   The `crypto` tactics handles induction, and can thus prove indistinguishability
   for all frames. Proving such goals can be useful to support rewriting a system
   into a variant system, to reduce the proof on one protocol to a proof of
   the same property on another, simple protocol. *)
