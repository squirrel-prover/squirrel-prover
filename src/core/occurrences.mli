(** Overview:
    The [Occurrences] module provides ways to easily search for occurrences
    of anything in a term.

    - Users need to provide a module of type [OccurrenceContent],
      containing the type of the things they want to search for, and a few
      operations on this type.

    - The MakeSearch functor will take that module as a parameter,
      and produce a module of type [OccurrenceSearch],
      containing a function [find_all_occurrences].

    - Users need to provide that function with a [get_bad_occs] function.
      This function does not need to worry about unfolding macros, iterating
      through the term, or looking for indirect occurrences. 
      It only looks for the occurrences at top level in a term.
      It has access to two continuations :
      * one to "give up": return no occurrences, and ask to be called
        again on all subterms. suffices in most simple cases.
      * a second one, more precise, asks to be called recursively on
        some of the subterms only, for more complex cases.

    - [find_all_occurrences] will then take care of iterating through all
      direct and indirect terms, and return all found occurrences.

    - A second functor, [MakeFormulas], will take a module of type [ExtOcc]
      (that is built by [MakeSearch]), and provide a function to generate
      the proof goals associated to the list of occurrences found.
      Users may of course decide to only call that function on some of the
      found occurrences.

      We also use this formula to compute occurrence subsumption:

     - We could store the fset at the point where the occ was found, which would
       be more precise (we would need to prove the goal for the occ only in that
       fset). Since fold_macro_support does not give us the fset where the iocc
       is, we would still potentially be a little imprecise.
       We'll see if that's an issue later, for now we don't do that. *)
