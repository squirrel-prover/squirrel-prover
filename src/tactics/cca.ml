(* Look for occurrences using the Occurrences module *)

(** A [EOS.f_fold_occs] function.
    Looks for
    1) bad occurrences of the key [k]: places where a key with the same symbol
    as [k] is used other than in key position, ie
    - as enc key, if pkf = None (symmetric case)
    - as pub key, if pkf <> None (asymmetric case)
    - as dec key: as specified by the dec_allowed argument

    2) bad occurrences of the random [r]: places where a name with
    the same symbol occurs (in any position)

    3) occurrences of ciphertexts, with a key that has
    the same symbol as [k] (only in the symmetric case, ie if pk <> None.)

    2 may be surprising: one might expect that [r] is allowed to occur
    as long as it is as a random in an encryption with the same key,
    ie in [enc(m', r, k')] with [m = m' /\ k = k'].
    The issue is then that we would need to ensure that no decryption with [k]
    is performed above that ciphertext when [m = m' /\ k = k'] holds, which
    we do not check. So we just reject any occurrence of [r], which is sound.
    Note that occurrences where [m'] and [k'] are syntactically [m] and [k]
    are fine, as they will be all be replaced with a name. *)

    the random [r], the key [k]:
    - no decryption with [k] is present above the ciphertext in the [context]
    - [k] is correctly used
    - the randomness [r] does not occur elsewhere
    - the other randoms are fresh (only used once).
