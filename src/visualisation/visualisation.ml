(** {2 Nodes list} 

    Compute the list of timestamps happening and group them into equality
    classes.

    TODO:
    - when adding a term, add all the terms on which the former term depends;
    - when there is no model, do not compute anything but report a useful
      message to the user;
    - provide the user with the ability to visualize all the elements of
      an equality class;
    - dump more precise information about relationships: currently we only
      document non-strict inequalities, but it would be useful to visualize
      when they are strict.
