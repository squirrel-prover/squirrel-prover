hash h.

(** We have declared [h] as a keyed hash function satisfying
    the PRF assumption: it is a family of pseudorandom functions.
    Our functions also satisfy collision resistance, which
    enables the `collision` tactic. *)
lemma _ : h(a,k) = h(b,k) => a = b.
Proof.
  intro H.
  (* The collision tactic applies to an equality
     h(u,k) = h(v,k) where h is a hash function, and adds
     the equalities u = v as hypothesis.
     In this example, the equality deduced is
     introduced right away using =>. *)
  collision H; intro Hcoll.

lemma hash_1 : h(h(a,k),k) = h(h(b,k),k) => a = b.
Proof.
  admit. (* TODO *)
Qed.

(** PRF also implies EUF (unforgeability).
    This is expressed through the `euf` tactic. *)
lemma _ : <h(b,k), h(c,k)> = h(a,k) => a = b || a = c.
Proof.
  intro H.
  (* The euf tactic must be invoked on an assumption
     of the form `h(v,k) = u` (or the converse).
     From this it deduces that `v` must be equal to one
     of the messages that is hashed (using `k`) inside
     `u` or `v`: for each case in this disjunction it introduces
     a new subgoal with corresponding hypotheses.
     In the next example we have two subgoals.
     Look carefully at the Heuf assumption in each one. *)
  euf H; intro Heuf.

  + auto.

lemma hash_2 : h(a,k) <> a. (* We could similarly prove `h(a,k) <> b`. *)
Proof.
  admit. (* TODO *)
Qed.

lemma hash_3 : h(a,k) = h(h(a,k),k) => h(a,k) = a.
Proof.
  (* This is easily proved using `collision`.
     Try doing it with EUF only!
     Be careful: a straightforward application of `euf` in this
     case does not bring any extra hypothesis. *)
  admit. (* TODO *)
Qed.

(* The euf tactic also reasons about indices.
   For the equality `u = h(v,k(i))`, it needs to consider all possibles
   hashes `h(w,k(j))`, under the assumption that `i = j`.
   This allows to prove the next lemma. *)
lemma hash_4 (i,j:index) : h(a, k'(i)) = h(a, k'(j)) => i = j.
Proof.
  admit. (* TODO *)
Qed.


global lemma hash_5_lemma : equiv(diff(h(a,k),n),m).
Proof.
  prf 0.
  (* The `prf` tactic replaced the hash `h(a,k)` with a fresh name.
     It checked that `a` has naver been hashed before.
     In this exemple, this is trivially the case. *)
  by fresh 0.

global lemma hash_6 :
  [a <> b] -> 
  equiv(diff(h(a,k),n),diff(h(b,k),m)). 
Proof.
  admit. (* TODO *)
