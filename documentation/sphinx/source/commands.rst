Commands
=========

.. cmd:: Proof

  Enter proof mode with a unique subgoal
  corresponding to the previous unproved :n:`@lemma`.

.. cmd:: Qed

   Close the current proof, if it's completed (i.e. has no remaining unclosed goal).

.. cmd:: Abort

   Abort the current proof.

.. cmd:: undo {? @natural}

   :g:`undo n` undoes the :g:`n` (default 1) last sentence(s). 
   Concretely, the tactic restores the :g:`n`:math:`^{th}` previous prover state
   as the current one.

   In general :cmd:`undo` commands are not used in `Squirrel` scripts but used for
   `Proof-General <https://proofgeneral.github.io/>`_ navigation.

.. cmd:: Reset

   Reset the prover state. This command can be undone with :cmd:`undo` since it does not clear
   the prover state history.

.. cmd:: include @file

   Attempt to find file :n:`@file`.sp,
   first in the same directory as the current Squirrel file,
   and then in the theories directory.

     .. example:: Including theories/Core.sp

       .. squirreldoc::

          include Core.

   If you
   install squirrel (with ``make install``) and not running it from root directory of its
   sources, the theories directory is located in ``~/.local/bin``.


   
.. cmd:: set @ident = {| @bool | @natural }

   Set any squirrel :gdef:`option` using its :n:`@ident`:

.. cmd:: print {? @ident}

  Show the definition of a given :n:`@ident` if it is a lemma, function, name, or macro.
  :g:`print` without :n:`@idendifier` shows the current system.

  .. example:: printing a lemma

    .. squirreltop:: in

        lemma [any] foo : true.
        Proof.
          admit.
        Qed.

    .. squirreltop:: all

        print foo.

.. cmd:: print system @system_expr

  Print the system :n:`@system_expr`.

.. cmd:: search @term {? in {| @system_id | @system_exp } }

   Search lemmas containing a given :n:`@term` (that can contain
   holes ``_`` as specified in :n:`@sterm`). 
   A :n:`{| @system_id | @system_expr }` can be specified, otherwise the command searches in :n:`@any`
   system.

  .. example:: searching axioms with included patterns

    .. squirreltop:: in

        axiom [any] bar1 ['a] : exists (x : 'a), true.
        axiom [any] bar2 ['a] : exists (x : 'a -> 'a), true.

    .. squirreltop:: all

        search exists (x : _), _.
        search exists (x : _ -> _), _.


.. cmd:: hint rewrite @ident

  Add a rewriting rule from the lemma :n:`@ident` to the
  user-defined rewriting database. The lemma should establish a local
  formula consisting of a universally quantified conditional equality.
  In other words, it should essentially be of the form
  :n:`forall @binders, phi_1 => ... => phi_n => u = v`.

  The goal will be used to rewrite occurrences of :n:`u` into the
  corresponding occurrences of :n:`v`, assuming the conditions
  :n:`phi_1, ..., phi_n` reduce to :n:`true` (using :ref:`reduction`).

  .. example:: add rewriting rule

    .. squirreldoc::

        axiom [any] and_true_l (b : boolean) : (true && b) = b.
        hint rewrite and_true_l.

.. cmd:: prof

    Print profiling information.
